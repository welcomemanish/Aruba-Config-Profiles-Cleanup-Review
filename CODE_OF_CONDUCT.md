## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviours that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces — including the GitHub repository, issues, pull requests, and any other community spaces — and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported by opening an issue on the repository or by contacting the project maintainer directly via GitHub at [github.com/welcomemanish](https://github.com/welcomemanish).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
